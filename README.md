# Jumpy Blob 🟣 

**Jumpy Blob** is a fast-paced, arcade-style platformer built with **Python** and **Pygame**.  
You control a squishy, colorful blob that jumps across the screen while dodging rotating **Tetris-inspired obstacles**. Smooth physics, fluid animations, gradient backgrounds, and juicy squash-and-stretch effects make the blob feel alive.

Survive as long as you can. Every obstacle you pass increases your score. One hit — *splat* — game over.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- Jump and double-jump to avoid incoming obstacles
- Obstacles are falling and rotating **tetromino shapes**
- Each successful landing changes the blob’s color
- Score increases for every obstacle you successfully pass
- Endless gameplay with increasing challenge
